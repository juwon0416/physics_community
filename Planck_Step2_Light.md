# Step 2: The Radical Solution (Light Version)

In 1900, a German physicist named **Max Planck** solved the paradox with a strange guess. He suggested that energy doesn't flow continuously like water, but instead comes in tiny, discrete chunks—like grains of sand.

### The "Energy Packet" Rule
Planck proposed that energy is **quantized**. You can't have just "any" amount of energy; you have to have it in specific packet sizes.

*   **Low Frequency (Red Light)**: The energy packets are very small and "cheap" to make. It's easy for heat to create lots of them.
*   **High Frequency (Ultraviolet)**: The energy packets are huge and "expensive."

### Solving the Paradox
Because high-frequency UV light requires such massive packets of energy, an ordinary oven simply doesn't have enough thermal energy to create even *one* of them.

It’s like trying to buy a Ferrari with loose change. You might have a lot of coins (thermal energy), but if the minimum price (quantized packet) is too high, you can't buy it at all.

So, the dangerous high-energy UV light never gets created. The "infinite energy" is blocked because the cost of entry is too high. This simple rule saved the universe from exploding.
