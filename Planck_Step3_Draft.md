# Step 3: A New Universal Constant

At first, even Max Planck didn't believe his own idea. He considered the quantization of energy ($E=nh\nu$) a "mathematical trick" to fit the data, assuming that eventually, a classical explanation would be found. He was wrong.

The constant $h$ he introduced turned out to be a **fundamental constant of nature**, as important as the speed of light ($c$) or the gravitational constant ($G$). It sets the scale for the quantum world.

$$
h \approx 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J}\cdot\text{s}
$$

The existence of $h$ means the universe is "pixelated" at the smallest scales. Action cannot be continuous; it comes in strictly defined chunks.

**The Correspondence Principle**
Interestingly, if we let $h \to 0$ in Planck's equations, they revert exactly to the classical laws.
$$
\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{2hc^2}{\lambda^5} \frac{1}{e^{\frac{hc}{\lambda k_B T}} - 1} \approx \frac{2ck_BT}{\lambda^4} \quad (\text{Rayleigh-Jeans})
$$
This confirms that classical physics is just a special case of quantum mechanics, valid only when quantum effects ($h$) are negligible.
