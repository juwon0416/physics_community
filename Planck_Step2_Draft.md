# Step 2: Planck’s Radical Hypothesis

In 1900, Max Planck proposed a solution that was nothing short of revolutionary. To make the math work, he guessed that the energy of the standing waves could not take *any* value, but only discrete multiples of a minimum unit.

He postulated that energy is **quantized**:
$$ E_n = n h \nu $$
where $n$ is an integer, $\nu$ is frequency, and $h$ is a new fundamental constant (Planck's constant).

**Why does this solve the problem?**
At high frequencies (UV light), the energy gap $h\nu$ becomes very large. Thermal energy ($k_BT$) is not sufficient to excite these high-energy modes. As a result, the probability of occupying these modes drops to zero.

Instead of infinite energy, the high-frequency modes remain "frozen out" and empty. This successfully tames the Ultraviolet Catastrophe and perfectly matches experimental data.

$$
\text{Planck's Law:} \\
B_\lambda(\lambda, T) = \frac{2hc^2}{\lambda^5} \frac{1}{e^{\frac{hc}{\lambda k_B T}} - 1}
$$

This simple assumption birthed the field of **Quantum Mechanics**.
