# Step 3: The Pixelated Universe (Light Version)

Max Planck initially thought his "quantum packets" were just a mathematical trick to fix the oven problem. But he had accidentally discovered a fundamental truth about reality.

### A New Constant of Nature
The size of these energy packets is determined by a number now known as **Planck's Constant** ($h$). It serves as the "scale" of the quantum world.

### The Universe has a Resolution Limit
Just as a digital photo is made of pixels, energy and action in our universe are "pixelated." You cannot zoom in forever; eventually, you hit the graininess of reality.

*   **Classical Physics**: Assumes the world is smooth and continuous.
*   **Quantum Physics**: Reveals the world is grainy and discrete.

This discovery marked the birth of Quantum Mechanics. It meant that at the smallest scales, the rules of cause and effect operate differently than they do in our everyday lives. $h$ is the key that unlocks this hidden microscopic world.
