# Step 1: The Ultraviolet Catastrophe

In the late 19th century, physics faced a paradox. Classical theories correctly predicted the color of light emitted by hot objects (blackbodies) at low frequencies but failed catastrophically at high frequencies.

Imagine an oven with perfectly reflecting walls. Classical physics assumed that standing electromagnetic waves inside the oven could vibrate at any frequency. As the frequency increased, the number of possible modes became infinite. According to the **Equipartition Theorem**, each mode should carry an equal amount of energy ($k_BT$).

This led to an absurd conclusion: a toaster should emit infinite energy in the ultraviolet range, instantly vaporizing everything around it. This failure of classical physics became known as the **Ultraviolet Catastrophe**.

$$
\text{Rayleigh-Jeans Law (Classical Prediction):} \\
B_\lambda(\lambda, T) = \frac{2ck_BT}{\lambda^4}
$$

As wavelength $\lambda \to 0$ (UV range), the predicted energy $B \to \infty$. This mathematical divergence proved that the classical understanding of energy as a continuous wave was fundamentally flawed.
