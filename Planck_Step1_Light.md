# Step 1: The Infinite Energy Paradox (Light Version)

In the late 19th century, physicists encountered a massive problem that threatened to break their understanding of the world. It was called the **Ultraviolet Catastrophe**.

### The Toaster Problem
Imagine a simple toaster or an oven. As you heat it up, it glows red, then yellow, then white. Classical physics predicted that as objects get hotter, they should emit more and more energy at higher frequencies (like ultraviolet or X-rays).

In fact, the math predicted that even a regular toaster should release an **infinite amount of energy** in the form of ultraviolet light every time you turn it on.

### Why this was a disaster
If classical physics were true, opening your oven would blast you with lethal radiation. Every time you boiled water, the universe would explode. Clearly, the real world didn't work this way—objects glow safely and stop emitting energy at very high frequencies.

Something was fundamentally wrong with the old rules of physics. They needed a new rule to stop the energy from blowing up to infinity.
